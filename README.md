This is Django application for showing common best practices that I've learned over the years using this framework.

## Motivation
I very often get similar test tasks for job applications, so hope this project allows you to take a look
 at my code and give up such tests.

## Contribution
Mostly I try to build this project by my own, but I will be immensely grateful to you for pointing out shortcomings
 or possible improvements. Feel free to create issues.
